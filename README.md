Easy-Parceling
==============

A project that helps simplify and streamline the data layer of any Android-based project.

Consists of a project to facilitate automated generation of boilerplate code needed to serialize,
parcel between activities/fragment, and read from/write to XML files as well as an example/test
project that contains a few needed helper classes.

All in all, using this project will greatly increase the rate at which the data layer can be written,
ridding the nee of programmers to serialize and deserialize fields by hand, as well as removing the
need of nearly-repeated code when writing logic to make objects Parcelable.
